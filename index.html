                    <p>
                        I’m Christopher, a retired Army aviation mechanic with over two decades of experience
                        maintaining critical systems in high-stakes environments. My career has been defined by
                        precision, teamwork, and a sense of purpose, qualities I now bring to the field of software
                        engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Programming has been a passion of mine even before I started my aviation career. After retiring,
                        I decided to pursue it professionally. I am drawn to coding because of the creativity and
                        problem-solving it demands. There is nothing quite like seeing your ideas come to life or
                        tackling a challenging problem and finding the solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I’m earning my degree in Software Engineering at WGU while refining my skills in C#,
                        modern UI frameworks, and cross-platform development. My goal is to build a career that offers
                        flexibility and balance, allowing me to create impactful solutions while maintaining quality of
                        life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and spending time with my family. Both keep me grounded
                        and inspired as I navigate this exciting new chapter.
